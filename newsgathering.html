                   They had just won the Water Polo Division III National Championships, the highest achievement in Division 3 college sports. The team came home excited with what it had accomplished, but when it arrived at the airport, there was no one there to pick them up.

  “We had achieved the best you can get in Division III and nobody [gave] a crap [about] what us girls had done,”  math teacher Katie Collins said.

  This was how Collins felt as her girls water polo team arrived home to no welcome after winning the championship and being named the best Division III team in the country.

  Growing up as an athlete, Collins noticed that boys were often given more recognition for their achievements in comparison to girls who had achieved the same thing, if not something better.

  “My water polo team won the national championships my freshman year and we were the only team on campus that had won a division three national championship in [about] 30 years,” Collins said. “Whereas when the male football team won [the] league, [there were] celebrations for a week, parties and a parade.”

  The standard of rewarding men more than women is a theme that Collins has consistently experienced. She believes that part of the problem is societal expectations and gender roles. When she used to swim, she noted that boys would be celebrated for their achievements while girls were often ignored.

  Currently, Collins surfs competitively and she still notices the gender disparities taking place through different awards for men and women and how athletes’ bodies are expected to appear. To combat this problem of gender disparity, in September 2018, the World Surf League (WSL) announced that all of its competitions would offer equal prize money for both men and women.

  We are pleased to announce that from 2019, equal prize money will be awarded to male and female athletes across all WSL controlled events. The WSL is proud to be the first American-based global sports league to offer gender pay equality. #CatchThisWave pic.twitter.com/y8cY8nlTc8

  “That only happened this year, which is fairly pathetic in my mind, but it’s one of the first sports to say the prize money for men and women is going to be equal,” Collins said. “That’s a huge shift because that speaks volumes about saying how we value athletes, [with different] genders, in the same sport. ”

  Women who surf are encouraged to focus on the way they look and to seem more feminine. They are sometimes selected for competitions for this reason in order to make the sport more appealing to the audience.

  “[With] the example of like surfing or tennis, the way we treat some of those women who are in those sports, we want them to be good athletes,” Collins said. “But we(society) also want them to be these very sultry and seductive looking women [who] don’t over highlight [their] muscles and [their] strength because that’s not feminine.”


  Although these problems are not as obvious at MVHS, there are still certain issues, such as game times, that occur between girls and boys sports. The league gives more preferable times to boys water polo games making it easier for people to come and support them leaving girls with less support, according to junior Aadria Bagchi.

  “Parents tend to show up to boys games because it’s later in the evening It’s better timing and it works out for everyone,” Bagchi said. “Whereas our girls games [are] always after school or at inconvenient times for parents [to] come and watch.”

  To players, disparities can also be seen in how the games are run, as boys and girls teams have different standards in terms of playing. Physicality in girls games are treated differently in girls games versus how they would be in boy’s games shown through how the referees run the games.

  “For girls [water] polo, they assume that we’re weaker and can’t play as well and aren’t strong and stuff as boys,” Bagchi said. “So when referees come to our games, they’re easier at reffing and they’ll call fouls for the smallest things, which in a boys game would not even be considered physical contact.”

  With more light shed on these issues, the traditions are now changing. According to junior Silpa Ajjarapu, MVHS is making changes to fix these problems.

  “Last year when we had quad games, girls’ varsity would play last so that we would get the fans from boys’ varsity games to stay for our games,” Ajjarapu said. “More parents would come see us play later at night and it started to work because a lot of people started showing up to our games.”

  Through changes like these, Monta Vista has shown that with time improvements will be made. But these changes may never fully fix the problems that athletes face.

  “[MVHS] is a more progressive school, but I think we still have traditional ways of how we think about things and how we celebrate teams and sports and attendance to events,” Collins said.`    `
